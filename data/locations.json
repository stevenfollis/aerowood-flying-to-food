From EQY, fly to TYI then between the restricted areas to FFA. If you need fuel, MQI is 6 miles across the water from FFA. Then you can fly VFR down the coast, just offshore from the Outer Banks, drop in at HSE (Billy Mitchell field at Frisco/Cape Hatteras) and W95 (Ocracoke) and land at MRH. Return inland from there – or you can continue to follow the coast south but you’ll have to go offshore to avoid Restricted areas"
